"""Creative image files uploaded to a Nekt volume.

Child stream of `creatives`. The parent injects each creative's `image_url` and
`thumbnail_url` into the child context, so this stream issues no Graph API calls
of its own: both are public, tokenized fbcdn links that serve the image bytes
directly (no access token, and sending ours to a CDN host would be wrong). Each
file is downloaded and uploaded to the configured Nekt volume, emitting one
metadata record per uploaded file.

The shared download/upload mechanics live in `VolumeAttachmentMixin`
(nekt_singer_sdk); this stream only supplies the Facebook-specific bits — which
files exist for a given creative (`iter_attachments`) and how to fetch their
bytes from the public URL (`fetch_attachment`). The mixin is also what validates
the destination volume and `NEKT_DATA_ACCESS_TOKEN` at sync time, warning and
yielding nothing when either is missing.

Because the files belong to their creative, replication is driven by the parent:
`ad_updated_time` is the bookmark and `is_sorted = False`. A creative's files are
therefore re-downloaded and re-uploaded — overwriting the same volume keys, since
the key is derived from the creative id — whenever one of its ads is updated.
